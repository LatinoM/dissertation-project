## Description
The aim of this project is to create a 2D sandbox game where the player is tasked with creating factories that teach programming concepts to the player. The main idea is inspired off of *Turing Complete* where the player will first start off creating fundamental logic gates, but then slowly use pieces that they have made, to create a basic computer system.
I would like to branch off of this idea by making programming the main focus of the game, rather than the electrical engineering of a computer.
The project will teach programming concepts that are universal to most programming languages. For example: it will include concepts such as:
- conditional statements (if, >=, !=, etc...)
- flow control (for, while, etc...)
- objects and classes
As the player plays the game, they will build these different concepts and then use those concepts to further make more complicated programs. For example, the player will start off making variable blocks, and then use those blocks to create if statements, and then use those if statements to make loops, and use those loops to make functions, and then use functions to make classes, etc...
The layout will be somewhat similar to graphical coding interfaces, such as Scratch, where there will be components that fit together.
